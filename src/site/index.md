Even though this is a late Birthday Party for Aiden who did not get to have one in April, this is “not a birthday party”, and please don’t bring gifts.

We’ll be doing the 8 Towers Ropes course and Zip Lines.  The Towers are very tall, and zip lines fast.  Make sure you are ready to participate!

We’ll have pizza, water, and gatorade for the kids.

**The adventure starts at 1:30pm, but you must arrive 30 minutes early.**
